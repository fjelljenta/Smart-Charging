# Smart-Charging
Repository for our contribution to the Qiskit Global Hackathon 2021

During the hackathon we wanted to look at quantum algorithms for industrial NP-hard problems. Due to climate change we will focus on the impactful problem of smart charging. 

## The issue
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. In order to meet the Paris Agreement, all countries have to cut down their emissions drastically. Electric mobility will play a key role in order to reduce greenhouse gas emission in the transport sector. If more and more electric vehicles enter the streets, it will become more challenging for the power grid. Smart charging will be necessary to improve the flexibility of the electric grid. However, smart charging faces large sized combinatorial optimization problems, many of them are NP-hard. 

## What is Smart Charging?
Smart Charging means the intelligent charging of electric cars. Smart charging has many facets. Electric vehicles should, for example, be charged when it makes economic sense. This includes charging operations at times when electricity is cheap but also when it is possible,which means there is enough capacity available on the power grid. One also can take in account the needs of the car owner and use predictions when the car should be fully charged. Additionally, load management ensures that electric vehicles are optimally charged at their location. Whether at home or at work â€“ intelligent charging avoids high power grid upgrading costs and peak energy prices. Therefore it uses the resources optimally and makes it more comfortably for the car owner.

In this project we focus on a timing problem. This means we want to optimize the time a set of cars need to be charged. We imagine a charging station with a various number of charging points and more cars than available charging points. We now want to find the optimal order to charge these cars. To make the task more realistic, we take vehicles with high priority status, like ambulances or police cars, into account and give them a higher priority. In the end, we want to optimize the total weighted charging completion time for all vehicles in the set.

## Minimization of Total Weighted Load Completion Time 
We consider  n electric vehicles, so we have J = {1, . . . , n} charging jobs with durations T = {t1, . . . , tn}. These charging jobs need to be scheduled on a set I = {1, . . . , k}, where k is the number of charging points. To each job we assign a weight wj > 0, which gives the importance. The time at which a load j ends, is called completion time Cj. Our goal is to minimize the weighted total time of completion.
This is a classical NP-hard scheduling problem. One can see this problem as a weighted Max-k-Cut problem, which can be tackled by the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), at least in its k = 2 set up i.e. Max-Cut.
