# Smart-Charging
Repository for our contribution to the Qiskit Global Hackathon 2021

During the hackathon we wanted to look at quantum algorithms for industrial NP-hard problems. Due to climate change we will focus on the impactful problem of smart charging. 

## The issue
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Electric mobility will play a key role in order to reduce greenhouse gas emission. Smart charging will be neccessary to improve the flexibility of the electric grid. However, smart charging faces large sized combinatorial optimization problems, many of them are NP-hard.
